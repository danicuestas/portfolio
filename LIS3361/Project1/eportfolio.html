<h3> How I started </h3>
<p> I started creating digital content since I was about 10 years old. I started off by curiously adventuring the web and wondering how to make a website. I came across Wordpress.com first, and began working my way around the blog-making site and made websites dedicated to clubs, games, and more for my friends and I to enjoy. 
<br>
I entered the world of graphic design when I was 12 years old thanks to my middle school that was centered around the arts. I was taught how to navigate Photoshop and Illustrator.
<br>
Within my arts high school experience, I was taught Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro, and began to love the film world. While I was in high school, I began to collect my knowledge of all these programs and platforms and began to offer logo creations, commercials, advertisements, and more. Since then, I've been freelancing my work to those who were interested. </p>
