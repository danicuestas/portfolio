<h3>Work Experience</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b> Social Media Specialist </b>
<br> <I>University of South Florida Student Government</I> 
<br> I'm in charge of scheduling posts to social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. I'm expected to communicate not only within my marketing team, but also the executive and federal branch. I'm expected to be active on social media and research how to continuously increase discoverability and engagement on all platforms. One of Student Government's greatest known initiatives for our 1st consolidated term is transparency, which is where my position has high expectations in communicating frequently with the student body and creating a closer relationship between our students and Student Government. </li>

<li> <b> Digital Marketing Intern </b>
<br> <I> <a href= "https://www.delitewhitening.com" target="new"> Delite Whitening </a> </I> 
<br> Within this internship, I've been working on creating content for DÃ©lite Whitening. I've created animations, web edits, product photography, photo editing, video production for product advertisements, video editing, and social media content creation. I exercised skills in working with Wix, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and learning more about social media marketing. </li>

<li> <b>Creator/Owner </b>
<br> <I> <a href= "https://www.markedessence.com" target="new">Marked Essence</a></I> 
<br> I created and co-own this small business. Our mission is to support local artists, which we do through conducting free video interviews for our local artists' exposure purposes. I manage and produce all the video content creations, created the website and manage it using WiX, and direct our photoshoots, meetings, create the apparel designs and work with our printer, coordinate all scheduling and more. </li>

<li> <b>Full Time Assistant Manager </b>

<br> Promoted position added responsibilities involving leadership to teach the team better communication skills, product knowledge, and to develop techniques that were greatly recognized in myself while I was a Sales Stylist.
